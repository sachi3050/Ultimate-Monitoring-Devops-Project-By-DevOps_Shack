Sometimes, It gets hectic to use the codes from the docs and then, try to check it's indentations & all on YAML_Lint. 

So, What I did was "just copying and all required codes and pasting it on ChatGPT and Asking it to Generate a proper/Correct Indented yaml file for me. 
And then, Pasting it on YAML_Liint to check it's format. This was an Amazing Approach, It saves time !!

Try this way.
